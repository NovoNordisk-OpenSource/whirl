#' Normalize a Path with Respect to a Base Directory
#'
#' This function normalizes a given path with respect to a specified base directory.
#' If the path is relative, it combines the base directory and the path, then normalizes the resulting path.
#' If the path is absolute or starts with `~`, it normalizes the path directly.
#' If no base directory is specified, the current working directory is used as the base.
#'
#' @param path A character string representing the path to be normalized. Can be relative, absolute, or start with `~`.
#' @param base A character string representing the base directory with respect to which the path should be normalized.
#' The default is the current working directory (".").
#' @return A character string representing the normalized path.
