\description{
BioCompute is a standard for logs of programs for for Bioinformatics Computational Analyses.

The BioCompute object is a \code{json} log that can be created based on the output of \code{run()}.
}
\details{
The object consists of the following domains:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Specifications}:
\itemize{
\item \emph{spec_version}: Version of BioCompute used (`https://w3id.org/biocompute/1.3.0/``)
\item \emph{object_id}: Unique project id
\item \emph{type}: Your project type
\item \emph{etag}: Your \code{etag} id from the BioCompute Object Portal
