##  Overview
The whirl package provide functionalities for executing scripts in batch and simultaneously getting a log from the individual executions. A log from script execution is in many pharmaceutical companies a GxP requirement, and the whirl package honors this requirement by generating a log that, among other things, contains information about:

-   Status (did the script run with any error or warnings) \
-   The actual code itself \
-   Date and time of execution \
-   The environment the script was executed under (session info) \
-   Information about packages versions that was utilized
-   Environmental variables  

And all this is wrapped into a nicely formatted html document that is easy to navigate. 


## How to

The `path` argument in `run()` currently supports single scripts, multiple scripts, folders, and/or config files (more about that further down).
