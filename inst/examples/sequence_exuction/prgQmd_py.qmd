## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{python}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{python}
1+1

file_path = 'from_python.txt'

with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
    # Write or save text to the file
    file.write("Hello from python ^^")


```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
